            <p>
                I enjoy singing, playing guitar, and developing software professionally as well as for personal use. 
                I spent 3 years working as a Full Stack Engineer prior to my current job. 
                For nearly 2 years, I have been working as a Software Engineer for a Shipping & Logistics company.
