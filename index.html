                <p>
                    I enjoy singing, playing guitar, and developing software professionally as well as for personal use. 
                    I spent 3 years working as a Full Stack Engineer prior to my current job. 
                    For nearly 2 years, I have been working as a Software Engineer for a Shipping & Logistics company.
                    My family is from Puerto Rico, but I grew up in Hampton Bays, New York. 
                    While in High School, my family moved to Utah.
                    After I graduated, I went on a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to Boston, Massachusetts.
                    After returning home from my mission, I studied Computer Science at BYU for a few years.
                    I was unable to complete my Bachelor's degree after relocating too far from BYU campus to commute. 
                    Now, I'm trying to complete my degree using the wonderful BYU Pathway program.
